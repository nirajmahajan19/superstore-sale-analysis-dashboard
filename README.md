This Power BI project, titled Superstore Sales Dashboard, is designed to provide insightful visualizations and analysis of sales data from a fictional retail store. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of key performance indicators such as total sales, profit, quantity sold, and customer orders. Users can interactively filter the data by region, category, and time period to gain deeper insights into business performance. The project includes visual elements like KPI cards, trend analysis charts, and geographic maps to track sales and profit distribution across different segments and locations. It also highlights the top-performing products and customer segments, helping businesses identify opportunities for growth and efficiency. Built using Power BI Desktop and DAX, the dashboard template (.pbit file) is fully customizable and can be connected to a compatible dataset for dynamic reporting. This project serves as an excellent tool for anyone looking to monitor retail performance, support strategic decisions, or demonstrate data visualization skills using real-world business scenarios.****
